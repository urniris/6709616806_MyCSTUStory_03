        <h3>Introduction video</h3>
        <p>I'm just starting to study English, so I apologize for my poor accent I think learning English is essential for studying programming, so I've started learning it. English is important and can be useful for future opportunities.</p>
        <h3>About university studies</h3>
    <p>"University life requires a lot of adjustment because it's quite different from high school. For example, some days I have afternoon classes, and I need to be responsible for myself by regularly reviewing what I've learned."</p>
