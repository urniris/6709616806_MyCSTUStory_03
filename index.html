    <h3>About me</h3>
    <p>Hello My name is Pujira Younglier currently studying at Thammasat University in the Faculty of Computer Science I'm 19 years old and graduated from Benjamarachutit School. I'm interested in programming, which is why I chose to study here. My hobbies are listening to music and playing games. I've just recently started learning how to program, but I'm determined to keep studying and improving</p>

    <p>I'm just starting to study English, so I apologize for my poor accent I think learning English is essential for studying programming, so I've started learning it. English is important and can be useful for future opportunities.</p>

    <h3>About university studies</h3>
    <p>"University life requires a lot of adjustment because it's quite different from high school. For example, some days I have afternoon classes, and I need to be responsible for myself by regularly reviewing what I've learned."</p>
